1. portage support

2. use regexps on file names 
2. retrieve additional symbol information (such as symbol@version);
   use GElf_Syminfo *gelf_getsyminfo()
2. use obstacks for memory allocation speedup

3. symbol and table types selection (is this really needed?)
3. perhaps write russian docs, are they needed?
